# Token Contract in AssemblyScript

## Description

This project contains implementation of token contract similar to [ERC20](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard). The contract allows you to launch a new token on top of the NEAR blockchain which users can interact with as if it were any other token -- checking balances, transferring, etc.

This is a back-end contract only so there is no front-end included.


## To Run

*In NEAR Studio (https://studio.nearprotocol.com)*

1. Click the "Run" button on the top of the Studio window

2. You will be redirected to the output for the JavaScript tests described in `src/main.js` to show that the contract is performing properly.  This is a fully back-end contract so there is no front end.


## To Explore

See `assembly/main.ts` for the contract code and `src/main.js` for the JavaScript tests which define its usage.
